# Phase 5 — Architect Module

Goal: Keep interfaces and docs coherent across services; partner with manager.

## Role + Bootstrapping
- [x] Add architect agent bootstrap per rig or per cell as configured.
- [x] Define architect read-only guardrails by default.

## Responsibilities
- [x] Docs updates: require updates on API/contract changes.
- [x] Cross-service contract checks.
- [x] Design review requests routed to manager.

## Manager Integration
- [x] Architect can emit requests that become epics or cross-cell tasks.
- [x] Manager routes architect-driven changes to the right cells.

## Tests
- [x] Architect request flow tests.
- [x] Guardrails tests for architect read-only policy.

## Exit Criteria
- [x] Architecture and docs stay coherent as services iterate.
